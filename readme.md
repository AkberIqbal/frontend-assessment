Exercise 2 - mindArc_exercise2.html

##### Note
Need to install bootstrap locally (i did using npm install bootstrap)

* Explain why the result of `('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase()` is `banana`.
the second plus does more than concatenation and results in NaN (not a number error) because compiler is unable to add a character such as 'a', or 'b'... using toLowerCase just made it obvious
